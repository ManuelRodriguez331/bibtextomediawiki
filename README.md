# bibtextomediawiki
Converts Bibtex format into mediawiki syntax which is spoken by a famous encyclopedia 

**Description**
Creating a Wikipedia article or extending an existing one is only possible, if academic references are used. Unfortunately, the mediawiki system isn't using the bibtex format, but has developed it's own citation template. Converting from existing bibtex bibliographic references into the Mediawiki citation format is possible with the following Javascript project.

What the user has to do is to download the HTML file into a working directory, and open it in a webbrowser. Then, the bibtex citation is put into the left window and the converter produces the appropriate Mediawiki syntax.

The software is in a beta stadium, which means, that sometimes a parsing error is available. Another problem is, that special characters in the TeX format aren't converted correctly. So the user has to manual improve the generated text.
